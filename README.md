# google-books
This application uses the Google Books API to let users search for books.  The search page displays some details of the book and allows the user to select the "Details" button to get additional information.  Users are also able to save books as a Favorite and then view them on the Saved Books tab. 

## Motivation
My motivation for this project was to create an application that was easy to use and let users search for books that may interest them.  I also wanted to allow users to save their favorite books and have the ability to view them at a later time.
